# 01.06 Capturing Groups and Back References

## Capturing Groups

```regex
(\d)\d\1
```

The `\1` refers back to what was captured in the group enclosed by parentheses. If you have more than one Capturing Group, using `\1`, `\2` as sequence referring.

- `(\d)` matches the first digit and captures it
- `\d` matches the next digit but does not capture it because it is not enclosed in parentheses
- `\1` references the captured digit

## Match the whole number `707-827-7019`

Notice there're four `7` in the number, so below we capture first `7`, and refer it three times using Back References

```reges
(d)0\1\D\d\d\1\D\1\d\d\d
```
