THE RIME OF THE ANCYENT MARINERE, IN SEVEN PARTS.

ARGUMENT

How a Ship having passed the Line was driven by Stroms to the cold
Country towards the South Pole; and how fram thence she made her course
to the tropical Latitude of the Great Pacific Ocean; and of the strange
things that befell; and in what manner the Ancyent Mariner came back to
his own Countrey.

I.

1   It is an ancient Mariner,
2   And he stoppeth one of three.
3   "By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
4   Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?
5   The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,
6   And I am next of kin;
7   The guests are met, the feast is set:
8   May'st hear the merry din."
