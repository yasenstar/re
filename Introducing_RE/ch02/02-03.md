# 02.03 Matching Non-Digits

`\D` matches any character that is not a digit as defined by `\d`

- With _global_ flag, it matches all the non-digits in the string
- Without _global_ flag, it matches the first non-digit in the string

`[^0-9]`, which is the same as `[^\d]`, is a _negated range_, meaning that it will match any character that is not a digit.
